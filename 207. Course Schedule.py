207. Course Schedule 

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, 
which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, 
and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Note:
The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. 
Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

1. intuition: as long as there is no cycle, return true
how do we look for cycle?
hashmap to track which pairs weve seen
hashmap to track pairs [a,b]
