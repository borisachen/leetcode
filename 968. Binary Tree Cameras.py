968. Binary Tree Cameras
Hard/158/6

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree.

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

Example 1:

Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
Example 2:
Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
Every node has value 0.
------------------------------
We can do this greedily from the bottom up.
You never want to put a camera on a leaf.

Each node can have 3 states
2 = i'm covered by one of my child. empty nodes can be considered 2
1 = i have a camera, so i cover my parent
0 = i'm not covered by anything, so my parent needs a camera

    def minCameraCover(self, root):
        self.res = 0
        def dfs(root):
            if not root: return 2
            l, r = dfs(root.left), dfs(root.right)
            if l == 0 or r == 0:
                self.res += 1
                return 1
            return 2 if l == 1 or r == 1 else 0
        return (dfs(root) == 0) + self.res
