308. Range Sum Query 2D - Mutable

Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its 
upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).

Range Sum Query 2D
The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3), which contains sum = 8.

Example:
Given matrix = [
  [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
  [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
]

sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
update(3, 2, 2)
sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 10

Note:
The matrix is only modifiable by the update function.
You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRegion function is distributed evenly.
You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.

Naively:
Double for loop each time through the window.
This is O(n^2)

Maybe we can precompute something?
in a 1d vector, computing cumulative sum is good, since we can then take cs[i] - cs[j] to get sum(j->i)
we can expand this idea to the 2d case, by precomputing a 2d matrix where
a[i][j] is the sum of everything in the box to the top left
Thus when we need sum i,j, we take the whole box, subtract the two rectangles and add the small box.
