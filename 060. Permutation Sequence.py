"""60. Permutation Sequence

The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

The idea is as follow:

For permutations of n, the first (n-1)! permutations start with 1, next (n-1)! ones start with 2, ... and so on. 
And in each group of (n-1)! permutations, the first (n-2)! permutations start with the smallest remaining number, ...

take n = 3 as an example, the first 2 (that is, (3-1)! ) permutations start with 1, 
next 2 start with 2 and last 2 start with 3. For the first 2 permutations (123 and 132), 
the 1st one (1!) starts with 2, which is the smallest remaining number (2 and 3). 
So we can use a loop to check the region that the sequence number falls in and get the starting digit. 
Then we adjust the sequence number and continue.
